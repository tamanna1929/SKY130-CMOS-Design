<br>Brief description of the course
<br>This ten-day workshop, organized by VLSI System Design, was centered on CMOS circuit design and SPICE simulation using SKY130 technology. The sessions were structured progressively, beginning with the basics of NMOS device structure and operation, and gradually moving towards advanced CMOS inverter analysis. Participants explored transistor behavior in different operating regions, simulated DC and transfer characteristics, and studied inverter switching thresholds. The workshop further emphasized CMOS robustness by analyzing noise margins, power supply variations, and device-level variations. It concluded with discussions on process-related effects, such as oxide thickness and etching variations, and their impact on circuit performance.
<br>Key learnings and practical work included:
<br>1.Understanding NMOS structure and its performance in cutoff, resistive, and saturation regions.
<br>2.Performing SPICE simulations for NMOS Iâ€“V characteristics and CMOS inverter transfer curves.
<br>3.Analyzing CMOS inverter switching thresholds and deriving relations with device sizing (W/L ratios).
<br>4.Evaluating inverter robustness through noise margin analysis and supply voltage variations.
<br>5.Studying process variations (oxide thickness, etching) and their influence on single inverters and inverter chains.
